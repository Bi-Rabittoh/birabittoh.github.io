As you probably know, I like using free software (free as in _freedom_, not free of charge). Most people see users with this mentality as a group of paranoid psychopaths who circlejerk about their custom systems. While that's in part true, there's much more to it.

I often get asked by Windows or MacOS users about why they should think about switching to a GNU/Linux OS (which I'll be referring to as _Linux_); I'm just going to address everything here so I don't have to repeat it to everyone who asks.

I'll try to address every aspect where Linux is objectively better than the competition, then address some reasons you could have to stick to Windows or, like I did, set up a dual boot.

Linux is smart
--------------

Saying that Linux is for **everybody** would be a risky take. My point is that you _probably_ could benefit from using a Linux system.

If you're a programmer, Linux is the best you can run. As a programmer myself, I love using the terminal to do more stuff more quickly. I also love the level of integration you can have with the system, where a lot of programs are designed with a client/server model, which makes them work in complex scenarios as long as you have the time and patience to configure them properly.

If you're a student, Linux is also good for you since it's the best for quickly taking notes without the annoying Windows 10 updates popping up and rebooting your system seemingly at random. Every Linux system will probably be more lightweight than Windows, so you could use some old hardware you thought would never be using again and actually make something useful with it.


Linux is open
-------------

Using free software on an open source OS means you always know what's going on with your PC; if you get curious or have any suspects you can always read the source code (or trust that somebody already did it in your place). 

The good thing about Linux is that it doesn't hide anything from you. Whenever there's a problem, you can read various logfiles (with different levels of detail) to identify and troubleshoot your probably; it's also easier to fix problems since you actually know what each program and file does, while troubleshooting in closed-source OSes is like trying to fix a car engine without being able to open the hood.

Some distros, like [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), require you to set everything up from scratch; this means you always know exactly which programs you're installing and their exact function inside the Linux environment. I would only advise this kind of installation to advanced users, but after you do it the first time you'll certainly learn a lot about how a Linux OS actually works.

Your PC belongs to you
