# Data Mining and Data Warehousing

During 2020 at university, this subject ("Miner√≠a de Datos y Almacenes de Datos") had us write
blog posts as assignments. I think it would be really fun and I wanted to preserve that work
here, with the hopes it's interesting to someone.

The posts were auto-generated from the original HTML files and manually anonymized later.
