<p>Algorithms are a sequence of instructions that can be followed to achieve <em>something</em>. That something can be anything, and depends entirely on your problem!</p>

<p>For example, a recipe to cook some really nice food is an algorithm: it guides you, step by step, to cook something nice. People dealing with mathemathics also apply algorithms to transform their data. And computers <em>love</em> algorithms, too!</p>
<p>In reality, any computer program can basically be thought as an algorithm. It contains a series of instructions for the computer to execute. Running them is a process that takes time, consumes input and produces output. This is also why terms like «procedure» come up when talking about them.</p>
<p>Computer programs (their algorithms) are normally written in some more specific language, like Java or Python. The instructions are very clear here, which is what we need! A natural language like English is a lot harder to process, and ambiguous. I’m sure you’ve been in arguments because the other person didn’t understand you!</p>
