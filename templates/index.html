<h1>Lonami's Site</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website! This page has had several redesigns
over time, but now I've decided to let it be as minimalist as possible
(proud to be under 32KB!).</p>

<h2 id="about">About me</h2>
<p>Spanish male
<span id="age"><noscript>born in 1998</noscript></span>.
I have been programming
<span id="programming"><noscript>since 2012</noscript></span>
and it is my passion.</p>

<p>I enjoy nature, taking pictures, playing video-games,
drawing vector graphics, or just chatting online.</p>

<p>I can speak perfect Spanish, read and write perfect English
and Python, and have programmed in C#, Java, JavaScript, Rust,
some C and C++, and designed pages like this with plain HTML
and CSS.</p>

<p>On the Internet, I'm often known as <i>Lonami</i>, although
my real name is simply my nick name, put the other way round.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Project highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/">Telethon</a>:

game based on the original <i>1010!</i>.
