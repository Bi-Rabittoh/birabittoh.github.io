<p>This evaluation is a bit different to my <a href="/blog/ribw/16/nosql-evaluation/">previous one</a> because this time I have been tasked to evaluate the student <code>a(i - 2)</code>, and because I am <code>a = 9</code> that happens to be <code>a(7) =</code> Classmate.</p>
<div class="date-created-modified">Created 2020-05-13<br>

<p>Unfortunately for Classmate, the only entry related to NoSQL I have found in their blog is Prima y segunda Actividad: Base de datos NoSQL which does not develop an application as requested for the third entry (as of 14th of May).</p>
<p>This means that, instead, I will evaluate <code>a(i - 3)</code> which happens to be <code>a(6) =</code> Classmate and they do have an entry.</p>

<p><strong>Grading: B.</strong></p>
<p>The post I have evaluated is BB.DD. NoSQL RethinkDB 3ª Fase. Aplicación.</p>
<p>It starts with an introduction, properly explaining what database they have chosen and why, but not what application they will be making.</p>
<p>This is detailed just below in the next section, although it’s a bit vague.</p>
<p>The next section talks about the Python dependencies that are required, but they never said they would be making a Python application or that we need to install Python!</p>
<p>The next section talks about the file structure of the project, and they detail what everything part does, although I have missed some code snippets.</p>
<p>The final result is pretty cool and contains many interesting graphs, they provide a download to the source code and list all the relevant references used.</p>
<p>Except for a weird «necesario falta» in the text, it’s otherwise well-written, although given the issues above I cannot grade it with the highest score.</p>
