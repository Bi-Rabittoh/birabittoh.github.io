<p>This evaluation is a bit different to my <a href="/blog/mdad/nosql-evaluation/">previous one</a> because this time I have been tasked to evaluate student <code>a(i - 2)</code>, and because I am <code>i = 11</code> that happens to be <code>a(9) =</code> a classmate.</p>

<p><strong>Grading: A.</strong></p>
<p>The post I have evaluated is Trabajo en grupo – Bases de datos NoSQL, 3ª entrada: Aplicación con una Base de datos NoSQL seleccionada.</p>
<p>It starts with a very brief introduction with who has written the post, what data they will be using, and what database they have chosen.</p>
<p>They properly describe their objective, how they will do it and what library will be used.</p>
<p>They also explain where they obtain the data from, and what other things the site can do, which is a nice bonus.</p>
<p>The post continues listing and briefly explaining all the tools used and what they are for, including commands to execute.</p>
<p>At last, they list what files their project uses, what they do, and contains a showcase of images which lets the reader know what the application does.</p>
<p>All in all, in my opinion, it’s clear they have put work into this entry and I have not noticed any major flaws, so they deserve the highest grade.</p>
