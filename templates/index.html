<h1 class="title">BiRabittoh's Site</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>

<p>I'll write about whatever comes to mind, mainly technology and art,
so that people can read it when I get famous in 80 years or so.</p>

<h2 id="about">About me</h2>
<p>Italian male
<span id="age"><noscript>born in 1998</noscript></span>.
I've been programming
<span id="programming"><noscript>since 2016</noscript></span>
and I love it.</p>

<p>I enjoy art in every form, including video-games, as well as
every kind of humor. I usually hang around on Discord while
programming stuff I'll probably never actually get finished.</p>

<p>While Italian is my main language, I can read and write perfect
English. I'm a fast learner on any kind of programming language as long
as it follows human logic.</p>

<p>The name BiRabittoh comes from the Japanese pronunciation of
"B-Rabbit", as said in
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_Hearts">Pandora Hearts</a></i>,
which was the first anime I watched on the internet.</p>
