# Information Retrieval and Web Search

During 2020 at university, this subject ("Recuperación de la Información y Búsqueda en la Web")
had us write blog posts as assignments. I think it would be really fun and I wanted to preserve
that work here, with the hopes it's interesting to someone.

The posts were auto-generated from the original HTML files and manually anonymized later.
