<p>As the student <code>a(i)</code> where <code>i = 9</code>, I have been assigned to evaluate students <code>a(i - 1)</code> and <code>a(i - 2)</code>, these being:</p>
<div class="date-created-modified">Created 2020-03-16<br>
Modified 2020-03-28</div>
<ul>
<li>a08: Classmate (username)</li>
<li>a07: Classmate (username)</li>
</ul>
<p>The evaluation is done according to the criteria described in Segunda entrega del PC-Crawler.</p>
<h2 class="title" id="classmate_s_evaluation"><a class="anchor" href="#classmate_s_evaluation">¶</a>Classmate’s evaluation</h2>
<p><strong>Grading: A.</strong></p>
<p>This is the evaluation of Crawler – Thesauro.</p>
<p>It’s a well-written post, properly using WordPress code blocks, and they explain the process of improving the code and what it does. Because there are no noticeable issues with the post, they get the highest grading.</p>
<h2 id="classmate_s_evaluation_2"><a class="anchor" href="#classmate_s_evaluation_2">¶</a>Classmate’s evaluation</h2>
<p><strong>Grading: B.</strong></p>
<p>This is the evaluation of Actividad 2-Crawler.</p>
<p>They start with an introduction on what they will do.</p>
<p>Next, they show the code they have written, also describing what it does, although they don’t explain <em>why</em> they chose the data structures they used.</p>
<p>The style of the code leaves a lot to be desired, and they should have embedded the code in the post instead of taking screenshots. People that rely on screen readers will not be able to see the code.</p>
<p>I have graded them B and not A for this last reason.</p>
