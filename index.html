I've been programming <span id=programming><noscript>since 2016</noscript></span> and I love it.<p>I enjoy art in every form, including video-games, as well as every kind of humor. I usually hang around on Discord while programming stuff I'll probably never actually get finished.<p>While Italian is my main language, I can read and write perfect English. I'm a fast learner on any kind of programming language as long as it follows human logic.<p>The name BiRabittoh comes from the Japanese pronunciation of "B-Rabbit", as said in <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_Hearts>Pandora Hearts</a></i>, which was the first anime I watched on the internet.<h2 id=projects>Project contributions</h2><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/Render96/Render96ex>Render96ex</a>: working on the translation for this <i>Super Mario 64</i> port.<li><a href=https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo>nxengine-evo</a>: fixing the italian translation for <i>Cave Story</i>.<li><a href=#>URhythm</a>: ???</ul><p>If you're curious about my other projects, feel free to check out my <a href=https://github.com/Bi-Rabittoh>GitHub</a>.<h2 id=contact>Contact</h2><p>If you use Discord you can add me (<a href=https://discordapp.com/users/132123740724002816/>Bi-Rabittoh#5566</a>) and chat about anything.<p>You can also send me an email to <a href=mailto:andronacomarco@gmail.com>andronacomarco@gmail.com</a> and I will try to reply as soon as I can.</p><script>
