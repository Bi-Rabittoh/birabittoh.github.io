<p>During 2020 at university, this subject (&quot;Minería de Datos y Almacenes de Datos&quot;) had us write
blog posts as assignments. I think it would be really fun and I wanted to preserve that work
here, with the hopes it's interesting to someone.</p>
<p>The posts were auto-generated from the original HTML files and manually anonymized later.</p>
